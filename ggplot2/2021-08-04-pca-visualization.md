`ggfortify` lets `ggplot2` know how to interpret PCA objects. After loading `ggfortify`, you can use `ggplot2::autoplot` function for `stats::prcomp` and `stats::princomp` objects.

## Default plot



``` r
library(plotly)
library(ggfortify)

df <- iris[1:4]
pca_res <- prcomp(df, scale. = TRUE)

p <- autoplot(pca_res)

ggplotly(p)
```

PCA result should only contains numeric values. If you want to colorize by non-numeric values which original data has, pass original `data` using data keyword and then specify column name by `colour` keyword. Use `help(autoplot.prcomp)` (or `help(autoplot.*)` for any other objects) to check available options.



``` r
library(plotly)
library(ggfortify)

df <- iris[1:4]
pca_res <- prcomp(df, scale. = TRUE)

p <- autoplot(pca_res, data = iris, colour = 'Species')

ggplotly(p)
```

### What About Dash?

[Dash for R](https://dashr.plot.ly/) is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. 

Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.

Everywhere in this page that you see `fig`, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the `figure` argument of the [`Graph` component](https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph) from the built-in `dashCoreComponents` package like this:


``` r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
# fig <- fig %>% add_trace( ... )
# fig <- fig %>% layout( ... ) 

library(dash)
library(dashCoreComponents)
library(dashHtmlComponents)

app <- Dash$new()
app$layout(
    htmlDiv(
        list(
            dccGraph(figure=fig) 
        )
     )
)

app$run_server(debug=TRUE, dev_tools_hot_reload=FALSE)
```
