## Multiple Chart Types in R

How to design figures with multiple chart types in R.

### Chart Types versus Trace Types

Plotly's figure data structure supports defining [subplots](https://plotly.com/r/subplots/) of [various types](https://plotly.com/r/mixed-subplots/) (e.g. [cartesian](https://plotly.com/r/axes/), [polar](https://plotly.com/r/polar-chart/), [3-dimensional](https://plotly.com/r/3d-charts/), [maps](https://plotly.com/r/maps/) etc) with attached traces of various compatible types (e.g. scatter, bar, choropleth, surface etc). This means that **Plotly figures are not constrained to representing a fixed set of "chart types"** such as scatter plots only or bar charts only or line charts only: any subplot can contain multiple traces of different types.


### Multiple Trace Types with Plotly

Figures produced with Plotly have the add_trace() method, so it is easy to start with a Plotly figure containing only traces of a given type, and add traces of another type.


``` r
library(plotly)
data <- data.frame(
  Fruits = c ("apples", "bananas", "oranges"),
  Line = c(1,3,2),
  Bar = c(2,1,3))

fig <- plot_ly(data , x = ~Fruits, y = ~Bar, type = 'bar', name = 'Last Year') %>%
  add_trace(data , x = ~Fruits, y = ~Line, type = 'scatter',  mode = 'lines', name = 'This year')

fig <- fig %>% layout(yaxis = list(title = "Amount"))
fig <- fig %>% layout(legend=list(title=list(text='<b> Time Period </b>')))
fig
```

### What About Dash?

[Dash for R](https://dashr.plot.ly/) is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. 

Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.

Everywhere in this page that you see `fig`, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the `figure` argument of the [`Graph` component](https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph) from the built-in `dashCoreComponents` package like this:


``` r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
# fig <- fig %>% add_trace( ... )
# fig <- fig %>% layout( ... ) 

library(dash)
library(dashCoreComponents)
library(dashHtmlComponents)

app <- Dash$new()
app$layout(
    htmlDiv(
        list(
            dccGraph(figure=fig) 
        )
     )
)

app$run_server(debug=TRUE, dev_tools_hot_reload=FALSE)
```
