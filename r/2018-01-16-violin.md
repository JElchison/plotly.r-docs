#### Basic Violin Plot


``` r
library(plotly)

df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/violin_data.csv")

fig <- df %>%
  plot_ly(
    y = ~total_bill,
    type = 'violin',
    box = list(
      visible = T
    ),
    meanline = list(
      visible = T
    ),
    x0 = 'Total Bill'
  ) 

fig <- fig %>%
  layout(
    yaxis = list(
      title = "",
      zeroline = F
    )
  )

### What About Dash?

[Dash for R](https://dashr.plot.ly/) is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. 

Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.

Everywhere in this page that you see `fig`, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the `figure` argument of the [`Graph` component](https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph) from the built-in `dashCoreComponents` package like this:


``` r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
# fig <- fig %>% add_trace( ... )
# fig <- fig %>% layout( ... ) 

library(dash)
library(dashCoreComponents)
library(dashHtmlComponents)

app <- Dash$new()
app$layout(
    htmlDiv(
        list(
            dccGraph(figure=fig) 
        )
     )
)

app$run_server(debug=TRUE, dev_tools_hot_reload=FALSE)
```
